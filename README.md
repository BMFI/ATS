Advanced Teaching Systems Methodology.
Learning or discovery is accomplished by means of observation or means of substitution.For example, if it is not broken, so do not fix it.
Always test and measure the person, code or machine across the bench with the owner or guardian present. If it is not broken do not take it in for repair.Sometimes, the user may require to purchase some education to increase user knowledge, so understanding the person, code and machine and perfect or normal performance better.

Either it works or it does not. The insane mind performs the same methods, tasks, protocol or instruction set over ond over expecting a different result each time.

Interview the user and gather as much information as you can about the person, code or machine, so mabe if they dropped it?So, it may explain intermittent working and intermittent not working. For example, I remember one lap top which acted like it was infected with a virus, but discovered through diagnostics the lapTop fan was clogged with dust or bad.

Another time, I had a laptop infected with RedLof and I started it in safe mode to the CMD and restored it to a time before it was infected and I still have the old machine today. using CMD-C:> rstrui.exe

Do not just tear into the person, code or machine to repair. Do some research about you observation and tests and look for the easiest and less invasive fix and obtain informed consent in writing from the owner or guardian before any alteration or repair is done. Make sure they understand the risk. For example, a drinking straw was used on the lap top to unclogg the dust in the cooling fan without taking it apart.
I had a Dell t3600 I purchased as a bad machine and opened it up and there was a pound of dust in it. I put on my ground braclet and got my shop vacuum and vacuumed it out and cleaned it up, also I upgraded the Ram from 16GB to 64GB I am still using it today.

Computer code or programs are changing so fast , so the newer version sometimes deprecates old packages and modules or versions. Sometimes nothing will work, so either you have to experiment around and develop a new package or module or another way to get things done. For example, when python went from Python3.6 to 3.7-(2.7)3.9 and today, so some modules were created with Cython and would not work properly with python 3.7-(2.7)3.9 and today still do not work, so through experimentation I rolled back python to py3.6 and tested the packages and modules with py3.6 and they worked fine.So, I took my machine with Py2.7(3.9) installed on it and did an altinstall of py3.6 alongside py2.7(3.9), so I can use the module or package.

Use the science ritual for testing.
Document everything you do for future reference.
